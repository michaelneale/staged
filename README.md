# Staged

A desktop diff viewer for git repositories. View any diff between refs, review changes, and prepare commits. Built with Tauri (Rust + libgit2) and Svelte.

## What It Does

**Staged** lets you view diffs between any two git refs—branches, commits, tags, or the working tree. Select a base and head ref, browse changed files, and see side-by-side diffs with syntax highlighting.

Key concepts:
- **Flexible diffs**: Compare any ref to any ref (e.g., `main..HEAD`, `HEAD..@` for uncommitted changes)
- **`@` = working tree**: Use `@` as a ref to include uncommitted changes
- **Review sessions**: Mark files as reviewed, add comments (coming soon)
- **File watching**: Auto-refresh when files change on disk

## Development

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Hermit](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit) to manage development tools (Rust, Node.js, just). Hermit ensures everyone uses the same tool versions without global installs.

**First time setup:**

```bash
source bin/activate-hermit   # Activate hermit environment
rustup default stable        # Set the default Rust toolchain
```

After activation, `cargo`, `node`, `npm`, and `just` are all available from the hermit-managed versions.

### Quick Start

```bash
just install   # Install npm + cargo dependencies
just dev       # Run in development mode (hot-reload)
```

### Commands

```bash
just dev        # Run app in dev mode with hot-reload
just build      # Build for production
just frontend   # Run just the frontend (quick UI iteration)

# Code quality
just fmt        # Format all code (Rust + TypeScript/Svelte)
just lint       # Lint Rust with clippy
just typecheck  # Type check TypeScript + Svelte + Rust
just check-all  # Run all checks (format, lint, typecheck)

# Maintenance
just install    # Install all dependencies
just clean      # Remove build artifacts
```
